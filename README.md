### Greetings.

I'm Emir, a computer engineering student based in TR.

I'm interested in AI/ML and learning TensorFlow at the moment. You might want to take a look at my TensorFlow course [repository](https://github.com/CheesyFrappe/deeplearning.ai-tensorflow-developer-course), which was taught by [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/).

Here's what I've been programmed recently:
