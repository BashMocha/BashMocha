### Greetings,

I'm <b>Emir</b>, a machine learning aficionado with a strong passion for all things open source. I thoroughly enjoy delving into the intricacies of natural language processing and tinkering with state-of-the-art large language models.

At present, I'm engaged in the integration of visual language models with robotics as an intern researcher at [Ã‡ukurova AI](https://cukurovaai.github.io/), focusing on advancing human-robot interaction capabilities.

Here's what I've been programmed recently:
