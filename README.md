### Greetings,

I'm Emir, a computer engineering student based in TR.

I'm interested in AI/ML; specifically, natural language processing (NLP) and LLMs. You might want to take a look at my [ai-repository](https://github.com/CheesyFrappe/artificial-intelligence-stuff), which 
comprises several [courses](https://github.com/CheesyFrappe/artificial-intelligence-stuff/tree/master/Courses) and source codes for mastering AI concepts.

Here's what I've been programmed recently:
