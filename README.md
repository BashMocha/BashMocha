### Greetings.

I'm Emir, a computer engineering student based in TR.

I'm more interested in AI/ML, learning Python at the moment. You might want look at my Python [repository](https://github.com/CheesyFrappe/cs50-python), which taught by [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/).

Here's what I've been programmed recently:
